		The definition of bread according to Merrian-Webster is "a usually baked and leavened food made of a
		mixture whose basic constituent is flour or meal". While this definition is not wrong, bread holds a
		much greater significance when it comes to us humans. It was a reliable and practical food source for 
		thousands of years and has allowed us as a species to progress to where we are today. Bread would
		also play a large role in our history. This would be demonstrated in France during the late 18th
		century when the rising price of bread would be one of the major factors that led to the French revolution.
		Bread is ingrained in many cultures if not all cultures around the world in some way, shape or form and has still
		remained very revelant to this day. It is probably one of the most consumed foods in the world today if
		not the most consumed food in the world. Without bread, the world would not be where it is at today.
