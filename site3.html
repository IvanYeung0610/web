	 It would take thousands of years for the bread made by prehistoric humans 30,000 years ago to become what it is today.
	 There are three main factors that makes bread what it is today and one of them is <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-02-09-8601100787-story.html">fermentation</a>. This process was first
	 found by the Ancient Egyptians. This process was also probably discovered through an accident, very much like
	 how bread itself was discovered. The process involved microorganisms breaking down substances and releasing carbon
	 dioxide as a byproduct. This would create the loaves of fluffy and airy bread that we see on the shelves of the
	 supermarket today. At first this process was only viable through natural means but as time went on, people would develop
	 more efficient and advance methods for this step in making bread.

	 The second major factor was an improved quality of flour. Early on in the history of bread, grains would be
	 grounded by hand with a rock but in 800 BC, Mesopotamians found a method of refining this process and making it more effecient.
	 This refined method yielded finer and whiter flour which would be highly desired. This desire for whiter flour would be a trend in society
	 until recently. Nowadays health fads have made whole grain bread far more popular than it was in the past. The rich that use to buy white bread now
	 buy whole grain bread while the poor that used to buy whole grain bread now buy white bread.

	 The third and final factor contributing to how our bread is made today is mechanized slicing. Otto Rohwedder, a jeweler,
	 created the first mechanized slicing. While the idea did not garner much support in he beginning, it would eventually become
	 successful and 90% of bread sold in stores would be sliced. Due to these three factors the white loaves of sliced bread are
	 abundant in American supermarkets and has become a big part of American culture. Looking back on the origins of bread, this
	 food sources had evolved greatly from it's humble beginnings as gruel. It has not only become mass-produced white bread, but it has also
	 been adopted by many different cultures around the world and continues to norish people all around the world.
