	<h2>What is Bread?</h2>
	<p>
		The definition of bread according to Merrian-Webster is "a usually baked and leavened food made of a<br>
		mixture whose basic constituent is flour or meal". While this definition is not wrong, bread holds a<br>
		much greater significance when it comes to us humans. It was a reliable and practical food source for<br> 
		thousands of years and has allowed us as a species to progress to where we are today. Bread would<br> 
		also play a large role in our history. This would be demonstrated in France during the late 18th<br> 
		century when the rising price of bread would be one of the major factors that led to the French revolution.<br>
		Bread is ingrained in many cultures if not all cultures around the world in some way, shape or form and has still<br> 
		remained very revelant to this day. It is probably one of the most consumed foods in the world today if<br> 
		not the most consumed food in the world. Without bread, the world would not be where it is at today.

	<h2>The Origins</h2>
	<p>
		Bread was not always the white, fluffy, and filling norishment that many of us eat today. In fact for a large<br> 
		part of our history our diets mainly consisted of protein and fats from animals. While the exact method in<br> 
		which bread was first created is unknown, it is thought that bread was first made 30,000 years ago in an accident.<br> 
		It was known that prehistoric humans at that time were creating gruel, which was a combination of water and grain.<br>
		With this knowledge it was very possible that some of these prehistoric humans had accidently cooked this gruel and made<br>
		what we would consider as the first ever bread. While this concoction may have been bread, it probably would've<br>
		been closer to the flatbread that we eat today. It wouldn't be until much later that humans would learn to leaven<br> 
		bread.

	 <h2>The Evolution</h2>
	 <p>
	 It would take thousands of years for the bread made by prehistoric humans 30,000 years ago to become what it is today.<br>
	 There are three main factors that makes bread what it is today and one of them is <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-02-09-8601100787-story.html">fermentation</a>. This process was first<br>
	 found by the Ancient Egyptians. This process was also probably discovered through an accident, very much like<br> 
	 how bread itself was discovered. The process involved microorganisms breaking down substances and releasing carbon<br> 
	 dioxide as a byproduct. This would create the loaves of fluffy and airy bread that we see on the shelves of the<br> 
	 supermarket today. At first this process was only viable through natural means but as time went on, people would develop<br>
	 more efficient and advance methods for this step in making bread.

	 The second major factor was an improved quality of flour. Early on in the history of bread, grains would be<br> 
	 grounded by hand with a rock but in 800 BC, Mesopotamians found a method of refining this process and making it more effecient.<br> 
	 This refined method yielded finer and whiter flour which would be highly desired. This desire for whiter flour would be a trend in society<br> 
	 until recently. Nowadays health fads have made whole grain bread far more popular than it was in the past. The rich that use to buy white bread now<br>
	 buy whole grain bread while the poor that used to buy whole grain bread now buy white bread.

	 The third and final factor contributing to how our bread is made today is mechanized slicing. Otto Rohwedder, a jeweler,<br> 
	 created the first mechanized slicing. While the idea did not garner much support in he beginning, it would eventually become<br> 
	 successful and 90% of bread sold in stores would be sliced. Due to these three factors the white loaves of sliced bread are<br>
	 abundant in American supermarkets and has become a big part of American culture. Looking back on the origins of bread, this<br>
	 food sources had evolved greatly from it's humble beginnings as gruel. It has not only become mass-produced white bread, but it has also<br> 
	 been adopted by many different cultures around the world and continues to norish people all around the world.<br>
