	<p>
		Bread was not always the white, fluffy, and filling norishment that many of us eat today. In fact for a large
		part of our history our diets mainly consisted of protein and fats from animals. While the exact method in 
		which bread was first created is unknown, it is thought that bread was first made 30,000 years ago in an accident.
		It was known that prehistoric humans at that time were creating gruel, which was a combination of water and grain.
		With this knowledge it was very possible that some of these prehistoric humans had accidently cooked this gruel and made
		what we would consider as the first ever bread. While this concoction may have been bread, it probably would've
		been closer to the flatbread that we eat today. It wouldn't be until much later that humans would learn to leaven
		bread.
